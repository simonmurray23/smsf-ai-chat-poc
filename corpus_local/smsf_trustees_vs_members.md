# SMSF: Trustees vs Members (plain-English overview)

**Members** are the people whose retirement savings are in the fund.  
**Trustees** are the people legally responsible for running the fund.

In an SMSF, every member must be a trustee (or a director of the corporate trustee), and every trustee must be a member—subject to limited exceptions (e.g., minors, enduring power of attorney).

## Structures
- **Individual trustees**: Each member is a trustee. If a member joins/leaves, you must add/remove trustees and update ownership of assets (more admin).
- **Corporate trustee**: A company acts as trustee; each member is a director. Changes in membership usually mean director changes only (often less admin).

## Core trustee responsibilities
- Act in the best financial interests of members.
- Keep the fund **solely** for providing retirement benefits (sole-purpose test).
- Maintain an **investment strategy** appropriate to members’ circumstances (review regularly).
- Keep records, prepare accounts, lodge the SMSF annual return, arrange audits, and pay the supervisory levy.
- Ensure contributions, borrowings, and payments comply with the rules (e.g., contribution caps, conditions of release).

## Who can be a member?
Generally up to six members. Members must be individuals (not other funds), typically Australian residents for tax residency of the fund.

## Why it matters
Trustee obligations are legal duties. Breaches can trigger penalties and tax consequences. Many SMSFs choose a corporate trustee for continuity and simpler admin when membership changes.
