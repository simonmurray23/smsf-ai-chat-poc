A Self-Managed Super Fund (SMSF) is a private superannuation fund that you manage yourself. Unlike large super funds run by professional trustees, the members of an SMSF are also its trustees (or directors of its corporate trustee). This gives members control over investment decisions and responsibility for compliance with superannuation law.
