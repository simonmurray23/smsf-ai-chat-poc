Setting up an SMSF generally involves:  
1. Choosing members (up to six).  
2. Deciding whether to use individual trustees or a corporate trustee.  
3. Creating a trust and trust deed.  
4. Registering the fund with the ATO and obtaining an ABN.  
5. Opening a bank account and preparing an investment strategy.  

These are broad educational steps â€” detailed rules apply, and SMSF trustees remain legally responsible for compliance.
