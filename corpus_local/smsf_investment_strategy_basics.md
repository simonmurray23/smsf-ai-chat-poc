# SMSF Investment Strategy: What it must cover

Your SMSF must have a **written investment strategy** tailored to the fund’s circumstances and reviewed regularly.

## Minimum elements to address
- **Risk & return**: The level of risk you’re willing to accept and expected returns.
- **Diversification**: Whether investments are spread across asset classes (and reasons if not).
- **Liquidity**: Ability to pay expenses and benefits when due (e.g., pensions).
- **Liabilities**: Any borrowings and their impact on risk.
- **Insurance needs**: Consideration of whether to hold insurance for members.

## Review and evidence
- Review the strategy at least annually, or when circumstances change (e.g., starting a pension, member joining/leaving).
- Keep minutes/notes of reviews and rationale for decisions.

## Common pitfalls
- Strategy too generic (not tailored to your fund).
- No evidence of review.
- Asset allocation bands missing or very broad without explanation.
- Ignoring liquidity where pensions or large expenses exist.

A clear, tailored strategy plus review notes help demonstrate compliance and good governance.
